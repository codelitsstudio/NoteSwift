        content: `One of the biggest myths in education is that spending more hours studying automatically leads to better results. In reality, success is not about endurance or time spent—it’s about the strategy and methods used. This module challenges traditional notions of "grinding" and introduces a science-backed approach to learning. By focusing on intentional practice, active engagement, and targeted review, you can achieve more in less time while retaining knowledge longer. It emphasizes understanding your learning style, setting clear goals, and leveraging high-impact techniques that maximize productivity without burnout.`,
